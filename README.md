JavaScript library for building chains of HTML.

This is a simple library for building HTML. The need is that building HTML in JavaScript is hard.

 - Whatever editor you use, syntax highlighting is useless (because you are editing JavaScript, not HTML).
 - You are typing parts of HTML with JS interspersed, it is easy to get things wrong.
 - HTML/XML is a _lot_ of typing!

chains let you build HTML like so:

    var url = 'http://google.com';
    var msg = 'This is a link!';
    var html = chains.div().p().a({ href: url }).text(msg);

You can now render the html object using html.render() which will produce the following markup:

    <div><p><a href="http://google.com/">This is a link!</a></p></div>

Another way to do this in JavaScript is:

    var url = 'http://google.com/';
    var msg = 'This is a link!';
    var html = '<div><p><a href="' + url + '">' + msg + '</a></p></div>';

For my eyes, this is much harder to read, let alone type.

There is also a shortcut for defining the id of an element. If the first argument to the
method is a string, then it is assumed to be the id. This way, you don't need to use { id:
 'my-element-id' }

    var html = chains.div('my-element-id').p()

Elements strung together become a nested, each method invocation wraps the desired tag in
the previous tag. However, producing markup like the following is simple:

    <ul>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>

Just pass additional chains to the method call. Any chains will be appended in order inside the tag.

    var html = chains.ul(chains.li(), chains.li());

That's it, quickly build well-formed HTML using JavaScript.

You can also pass options to the chains object, such as indent=true. To do this, simply instantiate your
own chains object.

    chains = Chains({ indent: true });
    chains.div().p().a({ href:'http://google.com/' });
